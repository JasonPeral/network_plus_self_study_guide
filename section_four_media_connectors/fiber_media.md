# Fiber Media

- Is a method to transmit data using light instead of the common electrical impulses method like Copper media
- Fiber media offers significant advantages over traditional copper media based network(see below)

**TL;DR**

- **2 main types of fiber**

**Single Mode Fiber(SMF)**

- Designed for long distance as the small glass core allows light to travel without dispersion which can carry signals for distance of 10 - 100s of kms
- Preferred use case is back bone installations over vast areas

**Multi Mode Fiber(MMF)**

- Designed for shorter distances compared to SMF as the design allows light to travel in multiple paths  with max distance being 1 - 2km
- Preferred use case is network infrastructure applications like connecting servers to switches

### Advantages of Fiber

- Immune to EMI
    - Light based transmission is not affected by electromagnetic Interference (EMI) like copper based media.
    - Doesnâ€™t require shielding like twisted pair cables.
- Longer transmission distances with minimal signal loss
    - Fiber optic cables can span hundreds of miles
    - Suitable for local connections and transcontinental data transmission using underwater fiber optic cables
- Higher data transfer speeds
    - Can reach significantly faster speeds compared to copper cables
    - Can reach speeds beyond 10Gbps

### Drawbacks of Fiber

- Cost
    - Fiber is more expensive than copper cable
    - The higher cost are not just in the cabling but the networking equipment to support these types of speeds
- Complexity
    - More challenging to work with as it requires specialized tools and training for installation and repairs

### Two main types of fiber optic cables

- **Single mode fiber (SMF)**
    - Designed for long distance communication as the design features a small glass core typically around 8.3 to 10 microns in diameter (for reference a human hair is only 17 - 180 microns in diameter)
    - Because of this design the small glass core allows light to travel in a single path without dispersion. This tight path way allows the SMF to cary signals for longer distances like 10s or even 100s of miles.
    - SMF is preferred for backbone installations and connections over vast areas
    - Has a yellow sheath
    - TL;DR: for long-range transmissions with higher bandwidth
- **Multi mode fiber (MMF)**
    - Designed for shorter distances (1km - 2km) because it has a larger fiber core size that ranges from 50 - 100 microns
    - The Larger core size allows light to travel in multiple paths
    - Suitable for connecting servers to switches within buildings or campuses
    - Has aqua blue or orange sheathing
    - Ideal for internal network infrastructures and also is cost effective and is easier to work with to install.
