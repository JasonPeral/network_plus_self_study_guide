    ### Definition and core summary
    
    Copper media has been the default type of cable used in networks for decades which in-turn makes it an indispensable part of our network infrastructure

    ### IEEE 802.3 Standard
    
    - This standard defines the physical and data link layers, including MAC, for wired Ethernet networks
    - In simple terms this is what makes ethernet works â€” from how device talk to each other over cables to how data is structured and transmitted across LAN (commonly used in LAN)
    
    ### Twisted Pair Cable
    
    - Type of wiring in which 2 conductors of a single circuit are twisted together
    - Twisting these 2 conductors reduces electromagnetic interference and crosstalk from neighbouring cables
    - Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
        - Composed of pairs of wires twisted together without additional shielding being aded to the cable
        - Makes this type of cable lightweight, flexible and cost effective
    - Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
        - Includes shielding for better EMI protection
        - More expensive, bulkier and more difficult to install
    
    > UTP is good to use when the environment does not have a lot of EMI whereas STP is crucial for environments with a lot of EMI as the signal can get degraded over time.
