# Wireless Antennas

### Core Summary

- Antennas dictate the directionality and range of the signal that is being transmitted.
- Wireless antennas are devices that send and receive RF signals

There are 3 types of Antennas types

1. **Omni - Directional** â€” Transmits and receives signals in all direction equally
2. **Uni - Directional** â€” Transmits and receive signals with focused energy in a single direction for a concentrated beam
3. **Yagi Antenna** â€” Specific type of uni direction antenna that provides high gain signals due to its design

### Wireless Antennas

- Device that sends or receives radio frequency (RF) signals
- The type of antennas you choose greatly impacts the quality and efficiency of the wireless communications the antenna can support

## Types of antennas:

**Omni Directional**  

ðŸŸ¢Â Designed to transmit and receive signals in all directions equally.

- Makes it ideal for providing broad coverage with a relatively uniform signal strength
- Common use cases: wireless AP, Mobile Hostpots and public networks

**Uni Directional**

ðŸŸ¢Â  Designed to transmit and receive signals with a focused energy in a single direction for a concentrated signal beam

- Ideal for directing signals towards specific areas or a remote location that has long and narrow visibility where we would need strong signal in one particular direction
- Common use case: point to point connections, linking distance or 2 separate buildings together like multiple campus buildings

**Yagi Antennas**

ðŸŸ¢Â  Specific type of a uni directional antenna that provides high gain signal 

- Uses a narrow beam for long distance communication in a specific direction
- Common use cases: connecting to long distance cell towers or television transmitters
    - Yagi Antennas are unique in design as they are a type of uni directional antenna and consists of multiple parallel elements in a line which makes them highly efficient to pick up signals

### Considerations in Antenna Selection

- Tailor the choice of the wireless antenna on your needs and use case by factoring in the desired coverage area, signal range and physical environment
- The selection will impact how the network will perform and end users experience so its always important to choose the proper Antenna type to ensure strong and reliable connectivity
