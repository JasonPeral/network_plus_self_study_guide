# 802.11 Standards

*IEEE(Institute of Electronics Engineers)*

üü¢ ‚ùó*For the test: Need to know the name, frequency band it uses, max speed and max distance or range for each standard* 

### Core summary

Standards and their supported frequencies:

2.4GHz = b, g, n and ax

5GHz = a, n, ac or ax

6GHz = ax

- *Only wireless n and ax support dual band*

Different 802.11 standards:

- Wireless a
- Wireless b
- Wireless g
- Wireless n
- Wireless ac
- Wireless ax

### IEEE 802.11 Standard

- This standard defines the technology we use for wireless local area networks (WLAN) communication like wi-fi

### Wireless a (802.11a)

- Frequency Band: 5 GHz
- Speeds: up to 54 Mbps
- Range: around 35 meters

### Wireless b (802.11b)

- Frequency band: 2.4GHz
- Speed: 11 Mbps
- Range: around 140 meters
- Developed to be cheaper in the late 1990s which lead to widespread adoption

### Wireless g (802.11g)

- Frequency band: 2.4GHz
- Speed: up to 54 Mbps
- Range: 140 meters
- Offers similar speed and range as wireless a with the freq band of wireless b which made it cheaper in nature

### Wireless n (802.11n or Wi-Fi 4)

- Frequency Band: 5GHz and 2.4 GHz
    - 5GHz
        - Speed: up to 600 Mbps
        - Range: 35 Meters
    - 2.4GHz
        - Speed: up to 300 Mbps
        - range: 70 Meters
- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO used by wi-fi 4)
    - AP use multiple antennas to send and receive data at faster speeds
    - Data split across multiple antennas then multiplexed back into a single stream
    - Acts like a hub

### Wireless ac (802.11ac or Wi-Fi 5)

- Frequency Band: 5 GHz
- Speed: up to 6.9 Gbps or more

- Multiple-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO used by wi-fi5)
    - Allows multiple users to access the wireless network and AP at the same time.
    - Acts like a switch

### Wireless ax (802.11ax or Wi-Fi 6)

- Frequency Band: 2.4GHz, 5GHz and 6GHz (wifi 6e)
- Speed: up to 9.6 Gbps
- Uses MU-MIMO
- Fully backwards compatible with previous standards

---

### Summary

- Higher speeds = reduced distance coverage in a single AP
- When troubleshooting wireless networks keep in mind the compatibility of the device with certain 802.11 standards
- Refer to only the official 802.11 standards as devices we see in stores can be wrong and just have marketing tactics
