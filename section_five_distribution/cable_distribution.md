# Cable Distribution System

### Core Summary / Overview

- Cable distribution system is a organized system to connect the networks backbone in the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) to the → Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) and then to → End Users Wall Jacks and finally → End users device
- The design of a Cable Distribution System should be hierarchical for logical and functional placement within the building

There are many different components of a Cable Distribution System

| Main Distribution Frame |  |
| Intermediate Distribution Frame |  |
| Racks |  |
| Patch Panels |  |
| Fiber Distribution Panels |  |

### Demarcation Point

- Location where the Internet service provider (ISP) connection ends and network infrastructure and cabling actually begins for an organization or individual
- This marks the entrance of the Wide Area Network into the facility
- After the Demarcation point the responsibility of the network shifts onto the organization

### Main Distribution Frame (MDF)

- This is the main/primary starting point for interior cabling after the **Demarcation handoff from the ISP**
- The MDF houses the main point of presence(PoP) router and backbone switch
    - The PoP router manages traffic going in and out of the network
    - The Backbone switch manages traffic within the network / connects all network components

### Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)

- Branches out from the MDF to serve smaller areas or groups
- The IDF contains edge switches for local connections
    - **Edge switches provide network access to end users devices and is where the devices physically connect**
- Cable Trays
    - This is a unit or assembly of units that form a rigid structural system to securely support the cables and raceways as they move across the building
        - When we are installing cables Horizontally we are usually going to do this in the cable trays either in drop ceiling or beneath raised floor
        - Vertically — Vertical cross-connect, minimizing vertical cable crossing between floors

 

### Racks

- Holds various network equipment for efficient space management and easy access for ongoing network maintenance
- Different types of racks
    - 2 post — for lighter equipment / Patch panels / network cabling
    - 4 post — for heavier equipment servers / ups systems
    - Wall Mounted — Space saving solutions for smaller equipment where there is limited floor space
    - Rack enclosure — for high - value equipment where it is a fully enclosed rack. Offers a protected environment for high value devices

### Patch Panels

- Device or unit that has a number of jacks for the use of connecting and routing circuits for
