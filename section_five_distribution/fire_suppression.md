# Fire suppression system

### Core summary

- Fire suppression systems are crucial in case a fire breaks out within our data center.
- We have 3 different types of systems that we can integrate for fire suppression within our data centers
    1. Wet pipe system
        1. Sprinkler system with constant water in pipes
    2. Pre action system
        1. Like the wet pipe but requires a detector to go off along with the sprinkler prior to activation
    3. Special suppression system
        1. Uses clean agents to displace oxygen and suffocate the fire.

### Wet Pipe System

- Is the most basic of fire suppression system
- Components include sprinkler system with pipes always containing water
- Activation occurs when fire alarm triggers valve opening, releasing water
- This is common in most office buildings but defintely poses a risk of water damage to equipment if there are ever leaks or if the sprinkler gets triggered

---

### Pre Action system

- This system aims to minimize accidental releases by having almost a 2 factor authentication prior to releasing water
    - When I say 2 factor auth it is because this system requires both detector actuation and sprinkler activation before water releases.
- This system has enhanced security and prevention for false water releases

### Special Suppression System

- This special system uses clean agents like Halon, Carbon agents or inert gas.
- This system displaces oxygen in the room basically suffocating fire.
- Presents suffocation risk to people that are in the room when the system goes off
    - Requires alarms and supplemental oxygen for personnel

### Safety measures

- Install clean agents to prevent water damage to server room / data center equipment
- Make sure that the systems are professionally installed and annually inspected for proper maintenance
- While we always hope to not have fire incidents its crucial to be prepared by having a suppression system ready.
