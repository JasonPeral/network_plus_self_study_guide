# HVAC Systems

### Core summary / what is HVAC

- Technology designed for indoor environmental comfort that provides:
    - Temperature control
    - Humidity management
    - Airflow regulation
- HVAC is very import for optimal operation of hardware and networking devices

**Temperature Control**

- Is a topic that we always have to consider as computer networks and data centers house electronic equipment that can generates heat very fast.
- Overheating equipment can lead to hardware malfunctions and reduced efficiency.
    - Most networking equipment has **failsafes** designed to power off if it gets too hot to prevent damage from occurring. Good in a sense for the protection of the hardware but bad for network uptime and services running on that device.
- We want to maintain this temp range for max efficiency
    - Usually ranges from 20-25C or 68-77F
    - Some equipment would have more tolerance than others so its best to double check manufacturers recommendations for specific temps.

**Humidity Levels**

**Humidity == Concentration of  water vapor within the air**

- Too much humidity can cause condensation which can lead to corrosion or electrical shortage with devices
- Too little humidity can cause a static prone environment which can potentially damage sensitive equipment
- Optimal humidity levels are 40-60%

---

**AirFlow Management**

- This is important for dissipating heat generated by equipment in data centers where proper airflow management is crucial to prevent overheating or system shutdowns

- Port side exhaust and intake (Hot/Cold aisle configuration)
    - Strategic method of airflow distribution where server racks are positioned in alternating rows with cold and hot air facing the same aisle
    - This maximizes cooling efficiency and reduces energy consumption

---

**Design Considerations**

- Plan your data center layouts with HVAC factors in mind
- Ensure proper rack spacing and orientation(hot/cold aisle config) for efficient airflow
- Use raised floor systems to push cold air upwards into the racks where they will be expelled as hot air through the exhaust
- Configure ceiling plenums to return cooled air to the data center

**When configuring the physical installation of your data center its important to keep in mind that the integration of an HVAC system is imperative for uninterrupted operations and optimal performance of networking and data center equipment**
