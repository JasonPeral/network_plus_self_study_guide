### Core summary / what is HVAC

- Technology designed for indoor environmental comfort that provides:
    - Temperature control
    - Humidity management
    - Airflow regulation
- HVAC is very import for optimal operation of hardware and networking devices

**Temperature Control**

- Is a topic that we always have to consider as computer networks and data centers house electronic equipment that can generates heat very fast.
- Overheating equipment can lead to hardware malfunctions and reduced efficiency.
    - Most networking equipment has **failsafes** designed to power off if it gets too hot to prevent damage from occurring. Good in a sense for the protection of the hardware but bad for network uptime and services running on that device.
- We want to maintain this temp range for max efficiency
    - Usually ranges from 20-25C
    - Some equipment would have more tolerance than others so its best to double check manufacturers recommendations for specific temps.
