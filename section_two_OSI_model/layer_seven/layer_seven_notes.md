# OSI Model - Layer 7: Application Layer

### Application Layer

- Provides application-level services where users communicate with the computer.
- Focus on lower-level applications for Layer 7, such as **file transfer** and **network transfer**.

### Application Services

- Unites communicating components from more than one network application.
- **File Transfer**
- **File Sharing**
- **Email**

### Low-Level Protocols

- **POP3**
- **IMAP**
- **SMTP**
- **Remote Access**
- **Network Management**
- **Client-Server Processes**

### Services Advertisement

- This is where applications can send out announcements to other devices on the network.
- Devices can advertise the different services they offer.
- Example: A **wireless printer** on the network can broadcast:  
  *“Hey device X that joined the network, I am a printer, and you can use me to print things over the network because I am a printer.”*
