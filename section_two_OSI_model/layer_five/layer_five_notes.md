# Layer 5 (Session Layer)

## Session Layer (Layer 5)

### Overview

- Manages sessions, ensuring separate conversations to prevent data intermingling.

### Setting Up a Session

- Verifies **user credentials**.
- Assigns **session numbers** to uniquely identify and manage active sessions.

### Maintaining a Session

- Facilitates **continuous data transfer** between communicating parties.
- Requires **re-establishment** if the connection breaks.
- Includes **acknowledgment** of received data.

### Tearing Down a Session

- Ends the session once communication objectives are met.
- Can end through **mutual agreement** or if one party **disconnects**.

### Layer 5 Devices and Protocols

#### **H.323**

- Used for setting up, maintaining, and tearing down **voice** and **video** connections.
- Operates over the **Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)**.

#### **NetBIOS**

- Used by computers for **file sharing** over a network.
- Commonly associated with **Windows file sharing** systems.

### Key Considerations

- **Layer 5 issues** typically involve **protocols** and **software**, not specific hardware devices.
