# Network+ Self-Study Guide

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress and creating a comprehensive self-study guide for the CompTIA Network+ certification exam. The goal is to document key concepts, provide examples, and create a structured resource for efficient learning.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Log my daily, weekly progress in preparing for the Network+ exam.
- Organize study materials into easily accessible sections.
- Develop a personal reference guide for networking fundamentals, components, topologies, and more.

## Repository Structure (adding onto this as the notes expand)
- **`main_notes.md`**: A centralized document containing detailed notes and concepts from various study sessions.
- **`section_one_network_fundamentals/`**: Directory for specific topic breakdowns (e.g., network basics, components).

## Topics Covered
